It is therefore important that you are voting actively and regularly, according to the rapidly changing developments within the blockchain (witness & committees structure and stats, working proposals, etc.). Everything related to voting can be found {here} link.",
      "invitation_conclusion": "If you are not able to stay updated on the developments and an active voter, we suggest an alternative option - to delegate your votes to EasyDex, by choosing the official EasyDex account as a 'proxy'. This will be a great support for EasyDex as a project, and it will allow you to automatically vote for the same proposals as EasyDex. This will ensure that your votes (funds) are active on the network, and we promise that we will handle your votes with due diligence and responsibility, by supporting proposals that benefits the overall network and in partcular our users - the only way for EasyDex to succeed is for its users to succeed!",
