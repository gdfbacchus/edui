# Wallet

As you may have noticed already, this application is a web application and runs
in a browser. A connection is established to a trusted node in the network that
serves as a gateway to the rest of the ecosystem.


## Wallet Management

Furthermore, the user interface is capable of carrying and accessing several
separated wallets each containing possible several accounts and corresponding
funds. You can add, backup, and switch existing wallets in `Settings->Wallets`.
